## Introduction

In the American West, we wait in anticipation every winter for the precipitation that will dictate how full the rivers and reservoirs will be, the intensity of the wildflower blooms, and the severity of the fire season. These anticipations often take the form of phrases like:

>"_It's such a dry January._"  

or 

>"_This February is one of the wettest on record!_"  

or, most commonly, 

>"_It's so warm/cold/wet/dry compared to last year!_"

As humans, our perception of the climate is heavily influenced by recent events. This has a name in psychology: _recency bias_. 

We have at most 100+ personal data points to draw on for how seasonal patterns of precipitation "should" look, and about 150 data points for modern climate records and streamflow gauges. This is great, but the American West has had a somewhat similar climate for the last 12,000 years since the last Ice Age, and 150 years may not be enough time to capture all the possible variance in climate events.

This is where teams of creative and dedicated scientists have stepped in. The scientists have traveled all around the West, boring small holes in ancient trees and extracting [tree cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology). By measuring the size of each years' tree rings, it's possible to infer how wet the climate was that year, and from there the amount of streamflow in the rivers of the watershed.

This gives us an unprecedented look at several major river basins in the West over more than a millenium, vastly increasing our understanding of the region's climate. **Understanding the events of the past is crucial in planning for future climate variability**.

## Historical Record of three major rivers in the West ##

**The Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Colorado are three of the West's most important rivers. Reconstructed gauging stations marked with green circles.**

![Map of rivers](/img/gauge_map.png)

Tens of millions of people rely on the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Colorado Rivers for drinking water, agricultural irrigation, and recreation. I used the datasets avaliable from the [California Natural Resources Agency](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/paleo-dendrochronology-tree-ring-hyrdo-climatic-reconstructions) to build visualizations of these three rivers. I chose these rivers from a sample of about 20 rivers around the West, partly because they had a longer historical flow reconstruction.

**Figure: Historical flow over time in the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and the Colorado River.**

A 10 year running average of the flows of the three rivers over a millenium. There is considerable natural variability in the flow.

## Floods and Droughts ##

The tree ring data gives us a much coarser picture of the past than modern stream gauges. The tree rings can tell us how much water there was in a season, but it can't tell us if that water came in a sudden torrential storm or gradually, over a season. 

**Floods** usually happen over a short duration: There's too much water in too short of a timespan. Therefore it's tougher to infer what kinds of flooding happened in the past.

**Droughts**, however, occur over a long duration. Even if there were intense storms during a drought, the problem is one of too little water over too long of a timespan. Droughts are easier to identify using historical tree ring data.

## Drought in the West ##

**Each of the three rivers has experienced a wide variety of wet and dry years over the past millenium.**

In this figure, the river flows have been normalized to compare between rivers. Positive values are the number of standard deviations above the mean flow for each river, and negative values are standard deviations below the mean. The filled in line is the 10 year rolling average, and the lighter bars are individual years.

**It's easier to look at each river individually; below, you can see the history of each river's flow.**

One of the more striking thing about these figures is that there have historically been as bad or even more severe droughts than we've seen in the 20th and 21st centuries. Particularly on the Colorado, there have historically been very severe droughts.

## How often have bad droughts occurred? ##

I wanted to see if there was much of a difference in river basins between how often really bad droughts have occured.

**Figure: Percentage of Years in Moderate and Severe Drought**

![river flows](/img/moderate_severe.png)

It turns out that the rivers have fairly similar frequency of moderate droughts (defined as a standard deviation of > 1.5), but the Colorado has had considerably more time in severe drought (standard deviation of >2).

**Looking again at the Colorado River over time, we can see 3-4 instances of very severe drought.**

Interestingly, archaeologists have connected the [abandonment of Mesa Verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_Verde_National_Park#Pueblo_III:_1150_to_1300) around the end of the 1200s to one of the droughts I've marked as "Moderate." This shows that it's not just the severity (aka how low the 10 year rolling average) is, it's also the duration of the drought that is important.



# Conclusion #

The climate that we've experienced in the 20th and 21st century in the West isn't necessarily the norm for these major rivers.

As anthropogenic climate change starts to kick in, we should expect higher temperatures, which can intensify droughts. This could be balanced by an increase in precipitation, but the timing of this precipitation and runoff may be altered. Another cause for concern is the enlargement of Hadley cells, which drive bands of deserts around the world. However climate change unfolds, **we need to keep the past in mind and plan for the entirely plausible scenario of a drought unlike anything the modern West has experienced.**
